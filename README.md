personal site, designed and implemented by myself. 
For setup, followed the digital ocean guide:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-typescript-with-react


I learned how to use TS + React @ New Relic Inc. and decided to update my site.
Tried to implement this in another language first, but found that TSX was the way to go. 

todo: 
- update readme w/ discription of app
- confirm that the app can be distributed well with git clone
    - include steps to rerpduce site
