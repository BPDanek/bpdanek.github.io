personal site, designed and implemented by myself. 
For setup, followed the pluralsight and digital ocean guides loosly:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-typescript-with-react

Corey Housee's guide helped me wrap my head around why and when to use bundlers, transpilers for my webapp.

A note about this page from the builder:

For starters, I love photography; but only because I have always loved design. I deeply appreciate all the artistic subfields, in particular
visual ones like architecture, graphic design, animation. So much so, that I almost dropped out of computer science to 
try my hand at the craft, but that stuff is really quite difficult. I figured maybe there was another way, I'll keep taking 
photos of nice things for now. 

This is the mental space I lived in until my internship with 
New Relic, where I got to build a nice UI for the first time with HTML, CSS and React. I believe I can still find a way to become a 
great visual artist by following this subset of software engineering. This site is intended to be both a part of 
my portfolio, but also the portfolio. It's empty now, hopefully not for long. 

I learned how to use TS + React @ New Relic Inc. and decided to update my site.
Tried to implement this in another language first, but found that TSX was the way to go. 

Had a lot of fun learning how to use CSS and HTML properly, previously I just fennagled
my way thorugh the whole build process. This time I read through the MDN Docs: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS

I also found the snowpack, and babel docs helpful:


Some color inspiration found at: https://material.io/design/

A special mention goes to the ```display``` attribute for being an MVP with layout.

Another shoutout goes to Typescript 2.9 for implementing json import. I had a bad time trying 
to make a good data ingestion scheme for quickly pushing to the site. To see what I mean, check  
```~/src/assets/Me-Data/``` to see how I currently add content to the site.

todo: 
- upgrade to mobile friendly interface (react native or bootstrap)
