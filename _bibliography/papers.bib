	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising tool in healthcare applications. However, the reproducibility of many studies in this field is limited by the lack of accessible code implementations and standard benchmarks. To address the issue, we create PyHealth, a comprehensive library to build, deploy, and validate DL pipelines for healthcare applications. PyHealth supports various data modalities, including electronic health records (EHRs), physiological signals, medical images, and clinical text. It offers various advanced DL models and maintains comprehensive medical knowledge systems. The library is designed to support both DL researchers and clinical data scientists. Upon the time of writing, PyHealth has received 633 stars, 130 forks, and 15k+ downloads in total on GitHub.},

	abstract = {While machine learning (ML) research has recently grown more in popularity, its application in the omics domain is constrained by access to sufficiently large, high-quality datasets needed to train ML models. Federated Learning (FL) represents an opportunity to enable collaborative curation of such datasets among participating institutions. We compare the simulated performance of several models trained using FL against classically trained ML models on the task of multi-omics Parkinson’s Disease prediction. We find that FL model performance tracks centrally trained ML models, where the most performant FL model achieves an AUC-PR of 0.876 ± 0.009, 0.014 ± 0.003 less than its centrally trained variation. We also determine that the dispersion of samples within a federation plays a meaningful role in model performance. Our study implements several open source FL frameworks and aims to highlight some of the challenges and opportunities when applying these collaborative methods in multi-omics studies.},
